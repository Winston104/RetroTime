          The NES was originally released in Japan as the Family Computer
          (Famicom) in 1983. Following its success, Nintendo brought the console
          to North America in 1985. The NES quickly gained popularity due to its
          high-quality games and the innovative business practices of Nintendo,
          such as the licensing system that ensured a steady stream of quality
          titles.
